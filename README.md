# RSA-Keys-Generator-and-Signature
This notebook allows the generation of N RSA keys and the signing of any message using SHA256 and PKCS1v15.
You can change the endianess of the signature but be cautious of this option if using the signatures in another system.

We plan in the future to permit different hashing and signing algorithms.

# Requirements
- Python >3.8
- Pycryptodome library
